Felix Link to Eclipse

Felinx is an Eclipse IDE plugin to link to an existing Felix installation.
Felinx supports:
- auto update bundles on build
- debugging of bundles
- running existing Felix installation (including config.properties)

Felinx does not have a Felix installation incorporated.
It is up to you to choose which Felix installation you want to use and what the base setup is.
Felinx will start the Felix installation just as if you started Felxi from the command line.
